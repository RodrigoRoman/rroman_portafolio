For instance, the aerodynamics of airplanes were influenced by the observation of bird flight, and Velcro was inspired by the way certain plant burrs stick to animal fur. In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of a neuron is inspired by the biological neuron found in our brains. While artificial neurons differ significantly from their biological counterparts, they do share foundational principles in terms of structure and functionality. Biological neurons and artificial neurons both serve as fundamental units of processing and transmission in their respective systems. In the biological context, dendrites of a neuron receive signals, much like the inputs in an artificial neuron. The cell body processes these signals, akin to the computation done in the artificial counterpart. Finally, the axon of the biological neuron transmits the processed signal to other neurons, mirroring the output of the artificial neuron. While biological neurons deal with complex electrochemical processes, artificial neurons are inspired by this structure to process information in computational models.
