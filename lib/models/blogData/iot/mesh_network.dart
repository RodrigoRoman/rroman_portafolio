            "This article provides an insightful overview of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), highlighting their unique architecture characterized by interconnected nodes and specialized routers known as Mesh Routers (MRs). It delves into the crucial role of Internet Gateways (IGWs) in bridging WMNs with larger networks like the Internet, emphasizing the enhanced connectivity and network capacity this integration offers. Differing from Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), WMNs are portrayed as more stable and scalable, ideal for large-scale or dynamic environments like smart cities or IoT applications. The article also explores the importance of strategic placement of MRs and the use of orthogonal channels to optimize network performance, reducing interference and improving throughput. Additionally, it discusses the key role of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol in managing the complexities of WMNs, especially in multi-channel and multi-interface scenarios, crucial for maximizing network efficiency in the diverse and growing landscape of IoT applications."),

An increase in the number of IGWs relative to MRs, although not necessarily at the same rate, improves the network's overall capacity. This improvement occurs because a higher number of IGWs allows for a more balanced distribution of network load, reducing the likelihood of any single MR becoming a bottleneck. Consequently, the risk of congestion is diminished, as data traffic can be efficiently dispersed across multiple IGWs. This distribution mechanism enhances the network's performance, especially in handling high traffic volumes, and ensures a smoother, more consistent internet experience for all users connected to the WMN."""),

This approach aligns with the decentralized structure of WMNs, allowing for independent decision-making at each node, thereby enhancing network adaptability and efficiency. The implementation of a multiradio MAC protocol is particularly exploitable in these networks.
